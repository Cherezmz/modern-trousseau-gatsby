# Modern Trousseau Site

Ladies and Gentlemen, I congratulate you on nearly reaching the end of SEI 34. You have learned and endured much. It is time to put your skills into a more realistic environment, as we tackle a real-world client project. 

Before us is the [Modern Trousseau](https://www.moderntrousseau.com/) company. They make really nice wedding dresses for brides to be. Our job is to take this site up to another level.

## Design

The project has been fully designed and we have the comps in [Figma](https://www.figma.com), a web-based design tool:

One of your first jobs as a developer is to work with your design team. You want to be present in the conversations such that you can influence the design in a positive way. Designers don't always know the ins-and-outs of developing a website and part of your job is to help educate. It's a delicate dance but a good developer and designer working together will make much stronger products than either one can alone.

## User Stories

Our project's user stories are included in this repo, under the 'Projects' tab:

We're also lucky on this project to have user stories, which are a simplistic way to describe website functionality. You'll usually get assets like this from project managers and UX professionals who want to tell you the features they need on a site but don't have the technical depth to know exactly what needs to be built. 

There is usually a phase in projects where devs get to ask questions about these user stories. There might be features you don't understand fully or maybe a piece of a design is missing. Your responsibility as a developer is to get in front of that before work actually starts! We'll go through this process to start the project.

## Building Issues and Sprint Planning

Once your user stories are in place, we're going to make issues for our website. We'll subdivide into two teams - front-end and back-end. Each team will translate user stories into actionable tasks that can be executed inside of a sprint. For our project, we're going to use the [Github Issues part of this repo](https://github.com/jserrao/modern-trousseau-gatsby/issues) to create tasks for our teams.

Inside of the issues part of our repo, we have both labels and milestones. Make sure you are putting the right labels on your work (is it a Front-end or Back-end task?).

Each sprint we plan is typically two week long work periods where all parties on a dev team become responsible for a subset of the larger project. When you're doing sprint planning, what you're really doing is translating a vision into reality.

On our project, our sprints will be a bit shorter because of how large our dev team is (a more typical dev team might have 3-4 members, not 10-12). One thing you'll likely see is that dev teams this large require more coordination and slow themselves down. It will be a challenge that should be fun to work through.

## Process

Once a sprint begins, devs will work with their team lead to work through the issues that have been assigned to them. You will be responsible for the tasks set up at the beginning of the sprint and it's responsibility to manage your time during the sprint period. You are welcome to reach out to your team lead and PM as necessary but your time management is up to you.

If you find you are falling behind or racing ahead of where you thought you'd be, this is the type of news you want to raise in your daily standup meeting. 

## Stack

For this project, we're using a [serverless Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). Serverless technology gives us the benefit of SaaS tools and a modern React front-end that will allow our back-end and front-end teams to work in parallel during the project. It's the stack of the 2020's, so learning it will put you ahead of the curve.

Specifically, we will be using a React-based [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site for the front-end and the SaaS CMS [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), deployments are automatically handled through [Netlify](https://netlify.com). This repo is already set up for a baseline Gatsby project, with a Contentful back-end integrated with Netlify for deployments. How nice of your project leads...

## Contributing / Branching

**Each issue assigned to you should be developed on it's own branch**! Please do not develop on `master` for any reason! This site uses continuous deployment from Github > Netlify on the master branch - if you push to master, you are pushing live! Be careful!
